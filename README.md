Hi and welcome to my test task.

* / Typescript / SCSS / Mui / custom Hooks / Redux /
* Search query saving in url
* Used "debounce" func for performance
* Predicted problems with api server (Error and Loading components)

I was writing with Material UI library first time and could use not the best solutions in my code.
But I tried to make it more readable.

Have a good day :)
